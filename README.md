# 📝 Tiptap Embed (Simple Editor)

This project is a **React + Vite** setup using **Tiptap UI Components – Simple Editor Template**.  
It’s meant to replicate the official [Tiptap Simple Editor demo](https://tiptap.dev/docs/ui-components/templates/simple-editor) locally and embed it later into a Bubble app.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alejosamudio/tiptap-embed.git
cd tiptap-embed
npm install
```

### Run the editor locally

Start Vite’s dev server and open the editor in your browser:

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173
```

### Production build

Generate an optimized build that you can host or embed elsewhere:

```bash
npm run build
```

To verify the build output locally you can spin up Vite’s preview server:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Linting

ESLint is configured for the project. Run it to catch issues before committing:

```bash
npm run lint
```
